The proposed CNN-based steganalysis model is designed to detect hidden information(steganography) in text by leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model employs a word embedding layer that maps words into dense vectors, improving the accuracy of word representations. It extracts both syntactic and semantic features from the text, making it more robust. For short texts (less than200 words), preprocessing involves word segmentation and encoding the words into indices based on their positions in a dictionary. On the other hand, long texts (more than 200 words) are tokenized into sentences of relatively consistent length before being processed, addressing the varying lengths of the text. The proposed LS-CNN model outperforms the HM-SVM- based approach for both short and long texts, achieving 100% accuracy in some cases and overcoming the limitations of previous models.
